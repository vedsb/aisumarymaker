[0.00 - 2.48] Imagine that you control the drone.
[2.48 - 7.28] The drone looks at that reality where it is.
[7.28 - 14.32] It sends me information and I get the conscious experience of what the drone is seeing.
[14.32 - 17.60] That conscious experience is not in my body.
[17.60 - 18.80] It is in my consciousness.
[20.08 - 26.16] A scientific theory that basically states that our body is operated like a drone from a conscious
[26.16 - 27.36] quantum field.
[27.36 - 31.04] Which would mean that experience, quality, is not in your head.
[31.04 - 34.48] The quality of the not existing body, the existing field.
[34.48 - 37.28] People will find this crazy idea.
[38.32 - 41.76] It is crazy, but it is much closer to the truth.
[43.52 - 47.20] Federico Foszhin invented the first CPU, the touchpad,
[47.20 - 52.72] and worked on the first neural nets, which gave him the hope of creating conscious AI.
[52.96 - 59.04] Took me 30 years to figure out that mathematics is created by consciousness.
[59.60 - 62.80] And therefore I cannot explain consciousness with mathematics.
[62.80 - 69.68] People, many physicists think that there is emerging emergent properties in the purely classical world.
[69.68 - 73.76] It cannot be emergentism requires quantumness.
[75.84 - 81.04] Like some other renowned physicists, Foszhin is convinced that consciousness cannot be a classical
[81.12 - 82.96] phenomenon and has to be quantum.
[83.60 - 88.16] But his theory of quantum consciousness goes beyond any theories on the table.
[88.16 - 91.68] We have to go way beyond Scherninger's equation.
[91.68 - 96.96] We have to go into the rocks equation, but even beyond that, we have to go to quantum fields.
[96.96 - 98.48] And quantum information.
[99.44 - 102.96] A quantum information goes beyond the concepts of quantum fields.
[103.36 - 108.72] In fact, the only physicists that has been able to show the quantum physics
[108.88 - 113.20] derived from quantum information is an Italian physicist,
[113.20 - 121.04] Dr. Momma O'Leard de Riano, he showed that you can derive all the equations of quantum physics from quantum bits.
[121.04 - 127.68] Federico Foszhin reached out to Marudariano and together they published a paper and Foszrico wrote this book.
[128.24 - 132.96] If they are right, not only will they have an accurate theory of consciousness,
[132.96 - 136.88] they will also solve the mystery of the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
[137.52 - 143.20] Quantum information is the representation of inner experience and the collapse of the way
[143.20 - 148.00] function is the representation of my friend of the free world. What more do you want?
[148.00 - 149.84] That's crazy. That's crazy.
[149.84 - 152.24] Let's try and really understand this.
[153.28 - 156.00] Welcome to the Ascencia Foundation's YouTube channel.
[156.00 - 161.92] Thanks for watching and may I ask you to like and subscribe as it really helps us to grow our channel.
[162.72 - 168.64] Now this interview was recorded when Federico visited the Netherlands to present his new book
[168.64 - 174.48] Aerojuiceable. A link to the book and scientific papers are in the description below.
[174.48 - 179.04] And in his book Federico describes how a deeply personal experience
[179.04 - 185.28] Latin to start investigating consciousness. Therefore I found it interesting to start our conversation
[185.28 - 190.40] with this personal experience. Of course, after that we go into the theory itself
[190.40 - 193.68] In the chapter marks below you can see the topics we discussed.
[194.24 - 200.16] Now without further ado here is Siliconhero and consciousness pioneer Federico Fishing.
[200.16 - 203.76] Federico can tell us about a pivotal moment in your life.
[203.76 - 208.00] Namely the experience you had at Lake Tahoe, where it pronounced correctly.
[208.00 - 210.88] Yep. During your Christmas holidays of 1990.
[212.48 - 215.36] Yeah, I wasn't happy.
[215.84 - 221.04] And I reached everything that the world says that if you do all this stuff you should be happy.
[221.04 - 227.36] And I wasn't. I realized that I was faking, being happy because I needed to because I was
[227.36 - 232.16] running a company. I had to be enthusiastic and everything else but I was dying inside.
[233.12 - 235.68] So what's going on was wrong with the picture.
[236.48 - 245.60] And consciousness then became center stage in my life.
[245.60 - 252.72] Understanding that consciousness somehow was also connected with feeling, you know,
[252.72 - 255.04] that's spreading side. So what's going on?
[255.04 - 260.48] So I wanted to understand what consciousness is. So that's when, you know,
[260.48 - 267.60] I wanted to understand that from my own sake, not to do something about it, not to monetize,
[267.60 - 272.72] not to make a new technology because before it was all about, you know, doing something,
[272.72 - 277.12] you know, and now I've suddenly turned my attention inside because of the suffering.
[277.76 - 282.32] And it was in this climate that I had this extraordinary experience of consciousness.
[282.40 - 290.64] Now I can go to this Tahoe night, you know, in 1990 during the Christmas holidays,
[291.60 - 297.60] we had a whole map in Tahoe which is a late Tahoe is a beautiful lake of 2500 meters.
[298.24 - 307.36] And mountains and skiing is great. And so, you know, one night I woke up midnight, you know,
[307.36 - 316.80] I was thirsty when to get a glass of water and went back to bed and just waiting for, you know,
[316.80 - 322.00] go back to sleep and then thinking nothing. And always suddenly out of the chest,
[324.16 - 329.84] just you know, just energy was coming out of my chest, but it was love. And it was love.
[329.84 - 335.36] There was never felt before it was, it was love that was coming from me.
[336.00 - 339.44] How can love come from me? I mean, you know, I was, you know,
[339.44 - 347.76] unthinkable that love could come from me. And it was 10,000 times more powerful than any love
[347.76 - 353.92] that I felt before. I mean, and if I had never felt that love because it was unconditional love.
[353.92 - 359.60] Now I have a name for it. It was love. Period. It was, you know, yes, it was coming from me,
[359.60 - 366.56] but it was love. And it was light, it was white light, synthetic. It was, you know, like sparkles, you know,
[367.36 - 378.00] and it was coming out. And then it explodes and it's everywhere. But it's everywhere. But my consciousness
[378.00 - 384.64] is there too. So, not only my consciousness is within me, but it's also outside of me.
[385.52 - 394.32] And all of a sudden I realized, I am that. So, I am the observer and the observer simultaneously,
[394.32 - 400.96] but I retain my point of view. I retain my identity. I was still the same kid of five years,
[400.96 - 408.80] all the three years old kid that I, that I was then. And so, and that I am now. And so that identity,
[408.96 - 415.52] but so my, the only thing that I mean, the remain was that point of view. And then I realized,
[415.52 - 420.80] oh my God, this stuff is the stuff of which everything is made. Everything comes from this stuff.
[422.08 - 429.60] And my body was hard, it was vibrating, you know, like the cells of my body were resonating with this thing.
[430.08 - 437.36] The, you know, of course, the emotion, the feelings was love joy and peace. Because this,
[437.36 - 445.04] this stuff fell like, that's me. I'm at home. This is me. So, I'm finally home. This is the,
[445.04 - 450.96] you know, this is home. But so it was all mixed up. So, you can not separate this stuff.
[450.96 - 461.36] You know, love joy and peace. And then the mind was aligned, saying, this is the stuff of everything is made.
[461.36 - 469.36] So, I'm everything, but also the observer of everything. So, my, I'm a point of view of one
[470.64 - 476.64] with which one knows itself. And now is the centerpiece of this new theory of consciousness that
[477.20 - 483.28] we may talk later. Yeah, beautiful. I mean, I was a physicalist. I thought, you know,
[483.28 - 488.88] basically, you know, materialist because I study physics, you know, and everybody knows the
[489.84 - 494.64] consciousness comes from matter perhaps, we don't know how, but as to come from matter,
[494.64 - 500.40] what else can you come from? So, I mean, that was the mindset that I was. So, all of a sudden,
[500.48 - 506.64] how can, you know, now this is before matter somehow, you know. So, this must be the beginning of it.
[507.52 - 512.96] So, you know, that changed it. And that, you know, that started me in a completely different
[512.96 - 520.40] way or thaw going on in terms of my personal development and thinking while I was running synaptics.
[520.40 - 527.36] So, that was fine, but I spent from that point on 30 to 40 percent of my time trying to understand
[527.44 - 534.00] what happened and studying, doing meditation, you know, figuring, you know, anything that I could
[534.00 - 544.96] understand to understand what happened. But that picture actually is the end is now I can explain
[544.96 - 551.12] with this new theory of consciousness. I can explain exactly what happened and exactly why that is
[551.20 - 561.60] correct. Every single one of us is a field that is both the observer, the observer, and the actor.
[563.84 - 570.08] Every one of us is a field and it doesn't exist, this field does not exist in space and time.
[570.08 - 578.88] Space time is exist within these fields that we are, it's us. So, this changes the paradigm,
[579.76 - 585.04] but we need a change of paradigm because otherwise if we are machines like
[585.04 - 592.24] scientists, is telling us, we are going to be taken over by the machines.
[594.24 - 600.24] Artificial intelligence, the people will control powerful people will control.
